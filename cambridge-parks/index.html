          <p>
            Over the past several decades, Kendall Square has transformed from a
            former industrial area into a world renowned center of biotech, high
            tech research, and innovative companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over 5 acres of new and renovated public open space will be created,
            primarily at two locations, in the vicinity of Kendall Square in
            Eastern Cambridge.
          </p>

            </p>
            <div>
              This park will be the social heart of the community, a common
              space that everyone can call their own. Kendall Green will be a
              landscape of open lawns and water, a sun filled and activity
              filled park that also serves to cleanse urban stormwater before it
              flows to the Charles River.

              With its softball, street hockey and basketball courts, Fulkerson
              Park will provide sports program not currently found in the
              neighborhood, for example tennis courts, and a year-round turf
              soccer field.
