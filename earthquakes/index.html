    <h1>Earthquakes between 2008 and 2018</h1>
    <p>Earthquake data containing more than 245000 earthquakes with a magnitude higher than 2.5, which occurred between January 2008 and start of May 2018. The depth of the earthquake is inverted and displayed as altitude. Earthquakes are displayed as circles with magnitude <span style="color: #83e478">between 2.5 and 4.3</span>, <span style="color: #7af3ff">between 4.31 and 7.0</span> and <span style="color: #ff5400">higher than 7.01</span>. The size is proportional to the magnitude.</p>
