    <h1>Better access to education</h1>
    <p class="subtitle"> - Children stay longer in school compared to 30 years ago - </p>
    <p>Education is a basic right nowadays and most countries have managed to increase the access to education in
      the
      last 30 years. One way to measure this is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/expected-years-of-schooling"
        target='_blank'>the number of expected
        years of schooling</a>:</p>
    <p class='mainQuestion'>How many
      years
      of schooling would a child of school entrance age receive if the current age-specific enrollment rates persist
      throughout the child's years of schooling?
    </p>
    <p>In the chart below, the height of a bar represents the number of countries that fall within each range of expected 
      school years. If you switch 
      between <button id="select1990">1990</button> and <button id="select2020" class="selected">2020</button> 
    you can see this shift: more countries have a higher number of expected school years in 2020, compared to 2019. </p>
    <div id="histogram"></div>
    <p>In the map below <span class="data-country">most countries</span> have a chart that shows the evolution of the
      expected school years from 1990 to
      2021. <span class="no-data-country">Some countries</span> don't have data. We encoded the number of school
      years
      in both the color and the length of the bars, to make it easier to
      read:

    <div class="explanation">
      <div id="legend"></div>
      <p class="legendExplanation">
        Wide and blue bars mean more expected school years and shorter and
        light orange mean fewer expected school years.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1990, the country with the lowest number of expected schooling years is <button class="zoomTo"
        data-code="NER">Niger</button> with approximately 2 schooling years.
      By 2021, the number of expected
      schooling years grew to 7. In developed countries like <button class="zoomTo" data-code="AUS">Australia</button>
      the indicator varies from 17 years in 1990 to 21 in 2021. In most countries
      the
      number of expected schooling years grew from 4 to 8 years. The
      exceptions are countries with wars or conflicts. For example, in <button class="zoomTo"
        data-code="SYR">Syria</button> we can see a drop in 2013, after the Syrian
      Civil War started. </p>
