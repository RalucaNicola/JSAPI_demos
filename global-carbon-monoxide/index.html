          Carbon monoxide (CO) is released into the atmosphere primarily as a
          result of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass and other
          organic matter. CO is not considered a significant greenhouse gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Natural sources like <b>forest fires</b> or <b> volcanoes</b> can
          release large amounts of CO in the atmosphere.

          <b>Vehicles</b> produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct of burning
          gasoline or diesel fuel. <b>Industrial CO emissions</b> can come from
          manufacturing, mining, oil and gas production.

          <span class="symbolDescription">3</span> China's emissions of carbon
          monoxide are mostly given by urban and industrial pollution generated
          in and around industrialized areas like Beijing.
